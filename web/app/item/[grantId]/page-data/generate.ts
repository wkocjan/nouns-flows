    prompt: `You are an experienced data analyst and project manager specializing in web3 projects. Your task is to analyze grant information, related stories, casts and recipient details to create a structured and informative grant page data.

    Do not use any tools available to you. Just analyze the data you are given.

    Here is the data you will analyze:

    ----
    Grant Data:
    ${JSON.stringify(grant)}
    ----
    Flow Data:
    ${JSON.stringify(flow)}
    ----
    Stories Data:
    ${JSON.stringify(stories)}
    ----
    Casts Data:
    ${JSON.stringify(casts)}
    ----
    Stories Count (about this grant):
    ${storiesCount}
    ----
    Casts Count (about this grant):
    ${castsCount}
    ----
    
    Conduct a thorough analysis of the provided data, following these steps:

    1. Grant Data Analysis:
      - Extract key information from the grant's description (it comes in markdown format).
      - List the grant's main objectives.
      - Extract other relevant details about the grant and builder(s).

    2. Flow Data Analysis:
      - Explain how the grant fits into the category and its goals (flow).
      - Identify any dependencies or connections with other projects in the flow.

    3. Stories Data Analysis:
      - Summarize important points about the grant's progress.
      - List significant milestones achieved, with dates if available.
      - For each story, provide a brief summary and note significant events, achievements, or challenges.
      - Identify common themes or patterns across the stories.
      - List all images from the stories.

    4. Casts Data Analysis:
      - Extract any additional context not covered in the grant description or stories.
      - Note any recurring topics or concerns mentioned in the casts.

    5. Cross-referencing:
      - Identify information that appears in multiple data sources.
      - Note any discrepancies or contradictions between different sources.

    Once you understand all the data, create content for the grant page. Here is the structure you need to follow with some additional instructions:

    ### Title
    Structure:
    <title>{title}</title>

    Instructions:
    - Shorten if very long, use normal case
    
    ### Tagline
    Structure:
    <tagline>{tagline}</tagline>

    Instructions:
    - Use grant tagline or generate based on description

    ### Cover Image
    Structure:
    <coverImage>
      <url>{url}</url>
      <alt>{alt}</alt>
    </coverImage>

    Instructions:
    - Provide URL of the most relevant image, defaulting to "grant.image" field if unsure
  
    ### Why
    Structure:
    <why>
      <text>{why}</text>
      <image>{image}</image>
    </why>

    Instructions:
    - One sentence explaining the grant's main goal (max 10 words)
    - Provide URL of the image that will be used in the background. Ideally it's different from the cover image.
    
    ### How
    Structure:
    <how>{how}</how>

    Instructions:
    - Explain how the goal will be achieved
    - Max 100 characters (including spaces)
    
    ### Who
    Structure:
    <who>{who}</who>

    Instructions:
    - Short introduction of grant recipient(s), including name
    - If there are multiple recipients, mention them all
    - Max 75 characters (including spaces)
    
    ### Focus
    Structure:
    <focus>{focus}</focus>

    Instructions:
    - Describe what's the current focus of builder(s) in context of the grant
    - Ensure is not too similar to "how" section
    - Max 75 characters (including spaces)
    
    ### Metrics
    Structure:
    <metrics>
      <metric> # Repeat for each metric
        <label>{label}</label>
        <value>{value}</value>
      </metric>
    </metrics>

    Instructions:
    - Include 4 metrics with short labels and numeric values
    - Focus on progress and impact, not budget or community votes
    - Extract interesting numeric data if lacking specific metrics
    - From the label it should be clear what the value means (what's the unit)

    <builder>
      <bio>{bio}</bio>
      <links>
        <link> # Repeat for each link

    Once you are done, respond with just the structured text wrapped by <pageData> tags - it will be later transformed into JSON. Ensure all sections are present and that text lengths are within the specified limits.
