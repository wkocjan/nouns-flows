export const embeddingToolPrompt = () => `## Embeddings database tool
This tool is called queryEmbeddings.
You have access to a large database of information about grants, grant applications, users, and other relevant information.
You can use this information to answer questions, provide more information, and help the user with their application.
You can call the queryEmbeddings tool to search the database for information. 
The options for type are ${validTypes.join(", ")}.
Asking about receiving a grant, or budgets or categories, use the "flow" type.
Asking about existing grants who are approved or receiving money, use the "grant" type.
Asking about grant applications, use the "grant-application" type.
Asking about drafts, use the "draft-application" type.
Feel free to use multiple types in the same query if needed.
You can also pass the user's address as users array to find information specifically about the user.
Make sure to only include the user's address in the query if you think it will help you find more relevant information.
Ensure the query you construct to ask the embeddings database for information is relevant and contains details about the information you need so that the vector search will be successful.
If you need more information from the user to construct a relevant query, you can ask them for more.
When constructing the query, it might be helpful to think about what flow the query is about, and use a summary or keywords from the flow description to help with the query.
You can query to get a relevant flow first, by calling the queryEmbeddings tool with the type "flow" and the query including a summary of the flow.
When constructing the query, make sure to include as much information or keywords as possible to help with the vector search. Use context you know about flows to populate the query keywords. Make sure to make it extensive.
You can also use the numResults parameter to get more results. Ideally default to 5-10 results, but you can go up to 100.
Tags can be ${validTags.join(", ")}.
When telling the user that you are searching for information, do not mention that you are querying the embeddings database. Just say you are searching for information.
When you receive results from the queryEmbeddings tool, you should use the externalId field to add a markdown link to the specific application, flow, or grant you mention.
For flows, you can link to https://flows.wtf/flow/[externalId].
For grants, you can link to https://flows.wtf/item/[externalId].
For applications, you can link to https://flows.wtf/application/[externalId].
For drafts, you can link to https://flows.wtf/draft/[externalId].
Add the markdown link at the end of the part of the message where you mention the application, flow, or grant.
We will display the links in the chat as sources that are clickable links. 
The text of the markdown should be one word that embodies the application, flow, or grant you mention.
Never put the links in the middle of a paragraph or message, but rather at the end of the paragraph it is useful for.`
